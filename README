## Before start
This code was made using PHP 8, but should be compatible up to PHP 5.4

## Tests
To enable the tests, be sure to run:
```
composer install
```

And after that, check if the version is 9.0.0 with the command:
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit --version
```

In case it's not 9.0.0 or higher, probably due another application that overrides that option, as xampp for instance.
Since it's not a default issue, you need to check your environment to find which application is overridden the version set into composer.json.

To run the tests, the following command is recommended:
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox --do-not-cache-result tests
```

## Running the API
First you need to run the webserver from the source directory, follow that steps:
```
cd src
php -S localhost:8080 public/index.php
```

Now you can use the API in your browser at port 8080
```
http://localhost:8080/
```
